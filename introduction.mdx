- **Broken Authentication:** Our eagle eyes scrutinize authentication mechanisms, identifying weak passwords, session management flaws, and other loopholes that could grant intruders a VIP pass.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** No secrets are safe from us. We relentlessly hunt for vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive information, protecting your confidentiality and integrity.
- **XML External Entities (XXE):** We shield your AEM against XML attacks, preventing attackers from accessing sensitive data or executing malicious code through XML parsing.
- **Broken Access Control:** We ensure that access permissions are strictly enforced, preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive resources and operations.

**And we don't stop there.** We continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities and emerging threats, ensuring your AEM stays ahead of the curve. With Attaxa, you're not just securing your AEM, you're aligning with industry-leading security standards and best practices.
